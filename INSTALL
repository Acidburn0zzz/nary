You can install Inary on your system with a single command.

# ./setup.py install

If you are on a Solus or PisiLinux system, you should delete /usr/lib/pardus/pisi
when you are installing the SVN version

Inary requires piksemel XML processing library, Pardus configuration 
manager based SCOM and SCOM API in order to run.

If you are upgrading from an old INARY release you may have to 
run the following command as root:

# inary rebuild-db
